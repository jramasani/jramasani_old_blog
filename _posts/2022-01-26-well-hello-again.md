## Well, hello again, world! Glad to be back. 

Been away from the blogging scene since late 2014. Today I've stumbled upon GeoHot's [the singularity is nearer](https://geohot.github.io/blog/) and felt like writing again. 

I've recently stopped updating my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jramasani/) and plan to continue so. Will figure out a better way to share my street photographs taken after 2022-01-02 (Btw, hail [ISO 8601](https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/]))

Well, hello again, again.
